## What is BlueDot?

We are a group of arcade game players that enjoy designing and making open-hardware/open-source arcade devices.

BlueDot's currently has two members:

- [Vincenzo Fortunato] - Hardware engineer and software developer.
- [Marco Ruggiero] - Graphic designer.

From players, to players. Giving back to the community!

BlueDot Arcade is &copy; 2023-{{ "now" | date: "%Y" }} by [Vincenzo Fortunato](https://github.com/vinsfortunato).

## Where can I buy the devices?

You can buy our devices from our [shop][BlueDot Shop].

{: .warning }
> The shop website is currently not available. Please contact us at our [email][BlueDot Email] if you are interested in buying our devices.

Buying our products is the best way to support us!

## Can I make it myself?

Yes! You can build our devices yourself, modify them and use your own firmware. 

But keep in mind that our devices are designed with manufacturability in mind and sometimes this means that DIY is not easy. For example we use SMD components on our electronics boards which are not very easy to hand solder.

Unfortunately we can't provide you support if you decide to proceed this way but we are committed on providing you with the best documentation that we can produce.

We open-source our devices so you can repair them if they fail and let you customize them if you wish.

## How can I support your projects?

The best way to support us is to buy our devices from our [shop][BlueDot Shop].

But every contribution is welcome! Feel free to contact us at our [email][BlueDot Email] and visit our [Github organization][BlueDot Github] to access to projects designs and source codes.
